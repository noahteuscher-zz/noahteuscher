intro_paragraph: I baked my first loaf of sourdough bread about a year ago, and
  since then I haven't been able to stop baking it. By now I make way too much
  for myself and my roommates to eat alone, so I decided to begin sharing this
  passion more widely.

### The Recipe

I developed my recipe by incorporating pieces of recipes from several famous bakeries around America, most notably Ken’s Artisan Bakery in Portland, OR and Tartine Bakery in San Fransisco, CA. My recipe uses bread flour, whole wheat flour, and rye flour. I recommend toasting up this bread and serving it with warm cheese, jam, or your favorite nut butter. It also works great on sandwiches—my personal favorite is a grilled cheese with Gruyeré, pickles, caramelized onions, and Dijon mustard. Or just eat it plain!

### Purchase & Delivery

For the time being, I am only selling loaves of white sourdough bread. The cost of a loaf is $6. The cost is meant primarily to cover ingredients; furthermore, a portion of all sales will be donated to organizations fighting for 3 goals that I believe are particularly important for building a sustainable and democratic future: racial equity, universal basic income, and environmental protection. 

For the time being, I am only selling to people in the Atlanta area. You can either pick up the bread from my apartment in Midtown, or I can deliver it to you anywhere within a reasonable biking distance of Georgia Tech campus. Payment will be taken over Venmo at the time of pickup/delivery. 

Turnaround speed depends on how many orders are being placed (and how much homework I have), but I'll do my best to fulfill every order within a week or two.
